#### Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
- During a manual update to add a shiny new server, the load balancer decided to play a trick and included an offline server in the pool. Traffic went to the offline server, leading to service disruption. Classic!

**Resolution:**
- The load balancer settings were corrected to exclude the offline server.
- A thorough audit of the configuration was performed, ensuring no further shenanigans.
- Automated scripts were put in place to ensure that servers are up before they join the fun.

- Conduct training sessions for the Network Operations Team on best practices for load balancer updates. Knowledge is power!

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Load Balancer:**
   - Update to the latest version with improved configuration validation. New and improved!
2. **Automated Validation Scripts:**
   - Develop and deploy scripts to check server status before including them in the pool. Robots to the rescue!
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
